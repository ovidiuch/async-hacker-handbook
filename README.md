# The Asynchronous Hacker Handbook
_with great freedom comes great accountability_

## What you don't need to do
* Work from a fixed office 5 days/week
* Waste time in transit to/from work
* Have an 9-to-5 working schedule on a specific timezone
* Be available at any particular time of a working day (except for emergencies or explicit commitments) 


## What you need to do
###Be available
* Make yourself __as reachable as possible__ during working days.
* Respond to any inquiry in up to 24 hours in working days (unless explicitly taking day off). The average should be as low as possible, though. **Transparency is the gateway to trust,** and you can't work remotely without having trust established in your group; it's better to bring bad news earlier than to keep pushing blindly on something that doesn't have a clear progress.
* Have a __clear and open status__ for each of the working days—both past and future, it's OK if it changes the next day.
* Make your __location available__ on each working day (for both reliability and safety).

###Communicate effectively
Always strive for __excellent communication__ between you and your clients or fellow coworkers. Whether on voice call, video call or phone, make sure you apply the following tips.

* __Speak clearly and slowly.__ Sometimes bad connections may get in the way, you need to make sure that your message gets heard.
* __Be precise and concise.__ Long meetings are the death of productivity. Keeping them short and sweet means more time is dedicated to more important tasks.
* __Speak one at a time, don't interrupt,__ otherwise no-one can be heard.
* __Ask for confirmation__ that the caller heard and understood what was being discussed.
* Break up long speeches/monologues into smaller parts. __Ask for comments__ after each one.
* __Meet the team.__ Meeting face to face helps you better understand your coworkers and clients. You'll find it's much easier to communicate with and understand a person after meeting them IRL.
* __Avoid jargon and culture-specific phrases.__ English may not be the first language of many of the people you're going to be working with. Stick to simpler expressions if you find that their language level is lacking.

###Make email work
* __Be clear and precise.__ It's often easy to be misunderstood when communicating via email. Proofread and spell check before you press _send_.
* __Document everything.__ Remember the golden rule _email or it didn't happen_
* __Answer all questions asked.__ Incomplete answers or no answers at all can lead to frustration and wasted time.
* __Strive for autonomy__ Try to figure out things on your own, don't waste time asking questions that you could have answered yourself and that may come with a 24h delay.

## What you can do
* Trade weekdays with weekend days if you haven't got any previous commitments (not a healthy habit)

## Meetings
The async model is against meetings by principle, but there should be a means for them to happen in the remote context.

* __Pick the right forum.__ Discuss complex issues in meetings rather than using long email threads. If possible, all participants should be at their own computer, even the ones that are at the office. This promotes equality between local and remote workers.
* __Share documents__ either with _Microsoft Lync Server_ or _Google Docs_ you should have a way to get everyone looking at the same thing. Make sure to send documents ahead of time.
* __Keep notes.__  Write down the main points that have been discussed. Have a shared document where participants can write down suggestions and questions.

## Tools
###Software
* Share files with [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/) and [Skydrive](https://skydrive.live.com/‎)
* Host live meetings with [Skype](http://www.skype.com/en/) or [Microsoft Lync Server](http://lync.microsoft.com/)

###Hardware
* Have a __dedicated microphone or headset__ for voice calls, don't rely on your laptop's microphone which is usually of inferior quality and can pickup noise from your laptop's fan, disk, and keyboard.
* __Use video.__ Purchase a good quality HD webcam for video calls and opt for this method of communication whenever possible. Seeing a caller's face helps improve communication.

## Context and expectations
Working remote is not an optimization to the classical model and does not make the process easier. It's only part of a framework for __scaling a team while empowering each of its members,__ thus obtaining a sustainable network of people, where each person can be as important as the next one. __Responsibility is split between all team members__ and does not fall back on a restricted set of people. This aims to remove bottlenecks commonly found in the _waterfall_ model.

The advantages are obvious, but like with any other framework, it takes a while before reaching its full capability and becoming more proficient than before by using it. For that to happen the efforts must be not smaller, but bigger!

__Are you up for the task?__
