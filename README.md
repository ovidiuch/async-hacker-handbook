# The Asynchronous Hacker Handbook
_with great freedom comes great accountability_

## What you don't need to do
* Work from a fixed office 5 days/week
* Have an 9-to-5 working schedule on a specific timezone
* Be available at any particular time of a working day (except for emergencies or explicit commitments)

## What you need to do
* Make yourself __as reachable as possible__ during working days
* Respond to any inquiry in up to 24 hours in working days (unless explicitly taking day off.) The average should be as low as possible, though. **Transparency is the gateway to trust,** and you can't work remotely without having trust established in your group; it's better to bring bad news earlier than to keep pushing blindly on something that doesn't have a clear progress
* Have a __clear and open status__ for each of the working daysâ€”both past and future, it's OK if it changes the next day
* __Always look for something to do, ask around, help someone ship their project faster, start one from the backlog or propose a new one__
* Make your __location available__ on each working day (for both reliability and safety)

## What you can do
* Trade weekdays with weekend days if you haven't got any previous commitments (not a healthy habit)

## Meetings
The async model is against meetings by principle, but there should be a means for them to happen in the remote context.

## Tools
* join.me -- To Share you screen
* hangout.google.com -- To Video Chat with someone. (Sometimes you can't beat face to virtual face time)
* git -- Asynch, source control.

## Context and expectations
Working remote is not an optimization to the classical model and does not make the process easier. It's only part of a framework for __scaling a team while empowering each of its members,__ thus obtaining a sustainable network of people, where each person can be as important as the next one. __Responsibility is split between all team members__ and does not fall back on a restricted set of people. This aims to remove bottlenecks commonly found in the _waterfall_ model.

The advantages are obvious, but like with any other framework, it takes a while before reaching its full capability and becoming more proficient than before by using it. For that to happen the efforts must be not smaller, but bigger!

__Are you up for the task?__
